Lensfun definition for GoPro cameras.

Parameters are being defined iteratively by testing photos with Hugin Lens Calibration GUI.
When good results come out the definition will be submitted to the Lensfun project.

Testing of correction with gimp-lensfun-plugin and digikam.

Does not currently work right. Waiting to get back better calibration data.
